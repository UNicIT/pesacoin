Part 4
Genesis Mining

Run ./pesacoind -testnet ..
	I did not get the same error. I got the error for wrong rpcusername and rpcpassword 
	When i checked the debug.log, i realised that i already had the correct merkle 
	hash (2fc1b7ef46270c053711fbae934cf7f83378efd4b3e158079451d9c6c90e4700) set in main.cpp
	So i just created a pesacoin.conf file and set the rpcusername and rpcpassword and all was ok
run ./pesacoind getinfo .. OK. got same output as specified in the guide.
Commit and push code back to repo .. OK

Part 5

Main net
Genesis block
Setting epoch time .. Ok
	At first i thought since we had already set it in part 3, that was enough, but i realised i had to set it
	again.
Run ./pesacoind &  Exited with error
	Check debug log, i found wrong merkel hash. So i set hash line 2031 main.cpp to (30f45161daf297abf43af51debc254d3d616b34a7cbf78030eae4c7c973e959e)
	I set line 2034 to true
	rebulit the make binary
	then run ./pesacoind & again
	This time It started to mine the genesis block when i checked in the debug.log
	When mining finished , i had the error message `block.GetHash() == hashGenesisBlock' failed.
	In the debig log i was able to get the block nNonce and Blockhash
	I set these in line 32 and 2019 of main.cpp respectively
	I also set line 2034 to false, and also set line 27: to he new hash in checkpoint.cpp
	I then run make  to rebuild (make -f makefile.unix USE_UPNP=-) .. OK
	strip pesacoind ..Ok
	When i run it again ./pesacoind & , i got no error.
	I then committed and pushed the code to git repo
	

Mining Main net

Here i had to create a clone of my dev VM to create the client VM. This took me about 3 hours for the clone to 
complete
Once done, I had to change the IP address and restart the client VM
Running ./pesacoind -connect 192.168.1.10 .. Ok
running ./pesacoind getinfo on dev VM ..OK. I could see the connection from the client
./pesacoind getpeerinfo .. OK. I could see the IP of the client (192.168.1.11)

On client VM
./pesacoind getinfo .. ok I could see the connections set to 1
./pesacoind getpeerifo .. ok. I could see the dev VM IP (192.168.1.10)
./pesacoind getnewaddress .. OK
./pesacoind setgenerate true 16 .. OK
Started mornitoring. Was able to mine some blocks.
On Dev VM i could see the mined blocks.
./pesacoind getinfo .. OK
	
Part 6
Building QT-wallet

Running apt-get install qt4-default .. OK
Running ./qmake "USE_UPNP=-" .. OK
Running make .. OK
Stopping client .. OK
